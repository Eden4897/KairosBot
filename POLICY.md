# **KairosBot's Privacy Policy**

### By using KairosBot you accept with its privacy policy.

## 1. What data does KairosBot store?

- User IDs and their respective timezone

## 2. Who can access the data?

- Bot developer(s) (`Eden#2972`)

## 3. Why does KairosBot store the data?

It stores user IDs and their timezones because:

- The `/timestamp` command will default the timezone of the input to the user's timezone and calculate the appropriate timestamp
- The `/getusertime` command will use the user's stored timezone to calculate the local time of the user
- The automatic timestamp generation when the bot senses a time in a message will use the stored timezone to calculate the local time of the author so that the timestamp generated is relative to the author's local time.

## 4. How can we delete all our data?

Join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/J2xKqDKpGt) on discord and contact an online admin/moderator.

## 5. What if I need more help?

You can reach us by the following things:

- Join our [Support Server](https://discord.gg/J2xKqDKpGt) on discord
- Contact me on discord (`Eden#2972`)

## Please note, that we can change this policy without any warning at any given time.
